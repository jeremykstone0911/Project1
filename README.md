# Project1

We sought to create an app that does a random search of events on any given past date. When a user clicks the input tab, the app provides a calendar. They can choose a date in the past and our app randomly generates popular events from across the United States. It then provides the user with the title of the event, the location, and the venue. The user can then click the title link to see artist information and the venue link to be taken to the venue’s website. The app is essentially a novelty app, but can provide information for the user about events, artists,  and venues across the country that they may have never known about.
Essentially it’s a twist on “What songs were popular the day I was born?”
